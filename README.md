Instructions College project

Develop the necessary procedures in Visual Studio to solve the following problem, and define all local and global data used in them.

A library has a computer system that it uses to manage the stock of books it has for sale. A module of the system allows for different types of queries on the screen and printed reports. The data is stored in a database with the following structure:

You need to develop a window that allows the user to query books written in a language of their choice. The interface should have the following elements:

• A combo box with the names of the languages. When the window is displayed, it should be populated with data from the database.


• A command button that generates an on-screen report of the books corresponding to the chosen language.

• A grid where the report will be generated. It should have the following columns:
o Book Title.
o Year of Publication.
o Quantity in Stock.
o Unit Price.
o Total Price. This value is derived by multiplying the unit price by the quantity.

• A label that shows the number of books displayed (number of rows).

• A label that displays the total amount of the listed books. This value is obtained by summing the amounts shown in the last column of the grid (Total Price).

• A command button that exports the displayed data to a text file called 'ReporteLibros.TXT'.

• A command button that exports the displayed data to a text file called 'ReporteLibros.CSV'."
